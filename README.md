 # Helping-Hands


## **BHAGWA TEENS**

*MOTIVATION/PROBLEM STATEMENT*:
Due to less storage space availability of rooms and financial issues, many students can't afford a few items. Our app is intended for the proper sharing of resources.

*OBJECTIVE*:
This app ensures an efficient method of sharing items that cost a lot to pocket single-handedly within hostels of our college. Few students possess some objects which are too costly and don't use most of the time (e.g. piano, guitar, racquet,novels, boiler, etc.).By listing these items in our app, they can help the needy.


*METHODOLOGY*: 
Collect data of possessions of users of this app, their contact number and email ID, and room number. Users can either lend items or borrow items or both. They may also exchange their possesions, buy or sell physically. Proper searching algorithms and Data privacy would be included for a smooth and secure experience.
It also includes authentic identification of each user through their institute email id to curb any malpractices or spamming.
